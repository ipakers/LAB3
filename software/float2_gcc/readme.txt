Float2 GCC Example shows how to infer the floating point operations provided
by the Floating Point Hardware 2 component.  A user may inspect the objdump
file to see the code generated by GCC.

The Floating Point Hardware 2 component is the 2nd generation of floating-point
custom instructions for Nios II.  It offers improved performance, 
hardware acceleration of more operations, and reduced resource usage relative
to the 1st generation.  Results are not fully IEEE 754 compliant due to the
implementation of simplified rounding.

System Requirements
*******************
The following components must be connected to the Nios II:
  - 'Floating Point Hardware 2' component
