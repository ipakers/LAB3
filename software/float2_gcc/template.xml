           \n
           \nThe Floating Point Hardware 2 component is the 2nd generation of floating-point custom instructions for Nios II.  It offers improved performance, hardware acceleration of more operations, and reduced resource usage relative to the 1st generation.  Results are not fully IEEE 754 compliant due to the implementation of simplified rounding.

           \nSystem Requirements
           \n*******************
           \nThe following component must be connected to the Nios II:
