Float2 Functionality is a basic functional test of the 
Floating Point Hardware 2 component.  The program checks the results 
and displays a pass/fail message.

The Floating Point Hardware 2 component is the 2nd generation of floating-point
custom instructions for Nios II.  It offers improved performance, 
hardware acceleration of more operations, and reduced resource usage relative
to the 1st generation.  Results are not fully IEEE 754 compliant due to the
implementation of simplified rounding.

System Requirements
*******************
The following components must be connected to the Nios II:
  - 'Floating Point Hardware 2' component
  - Some character device (e.g. JTAG UART or serial UART)
